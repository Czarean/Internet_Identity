# `Internet_Identity and Principal Access Lists`

On this program you can learn how to implement an Access List hashmap that will contain a list of Principal IDs(Internet Identities)  
The Principals that are part of this Access List Hashmap will be able to call specific query and Update functions.


Instructions:  
1-the Anonymous Principal is already allowd on the Access List "acl.hashmap"  
2-The addPrincipal, and Authgreet Functions are restricted, meaning only Anonymous PID can call it!  
3-You can test this by login in with a new Internet Identity and try calling them, you will you cannot call them and get the error message!  
4-Copy the Principal ID of the new Internet Identity, open a new window, and log out of the new window.  
5-With the Anonymous logged in, add the new Principal via the addPrincipal Function.  
6-Go back to the window where the New Internet Identity is logged in, and try calling the addPrincipal, and Authgreet Functions  
7-You now should be able to call them

I am a noob developer; Motoko is my first language, and if you wish to help or advise me on the code, I would be very grateful and excited to collaborate and learn from other Motoko and Frontend developers. You can contact me via email, or private message on my X (Twitter) account, or Discord.
