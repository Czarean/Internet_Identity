# `Internet_Identity and Principal Access Lists`

On this program you can learn how to implement an Access List hashmap that will contain a list of Principal IDs(Internet Identities)  
-The Principals that are part of this Access List Hashmap will be able to call specific Query and Update functions.  
-The Princials that call the functions, that are not stored on the Access List Hashmap, will be denied Access.


Instructions:  
1-The Anonymous Principal is already allowed on the Access List "acl.hashmap"  
2-The `addPrincipal`, and `Authgreet` Functions are restricted, meaning only Anonymous PID can call it right off the bat! (Unless you add more PIDs via the `AddPrincipal Function`)  
3-You can test this by login in with a new Internet Identity and try calling both functions, you will find out you cannot call them and get the error message!  
4-Copy the Principal ID of the new Internet Identity, open a new window, and log out of the new window.  
5-With the Anonymous logged in, add the new Principal via the `addPrincipal Function`.  
6-Go back to the window where the New Internet Identity is logged in, and try calling the `addPrincipal`, and `Authgreet` Functions  
7-You now should be able to call them  

`Disclaimer: This might not be the best, more efficient or optimal code to accomplish this, but this certainly does the job, I did what I could with the lil knowledge I have gathered this past few weeks, So if you have any advise or feedback please let me know, I would appreciate it a lot, Thanks.`

I am a noob developer; Motoko is my first language, and if you wish to help or advise me on the code, I would be very grateful and excited to collaborate and learn from other Motoko and Frontend developers. You can contact me via email, or private message on my X (Twitter) account, or Discord.
